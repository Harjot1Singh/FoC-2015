<h2> Structure </h2>


<h2> Rules </h2>

- HTML/CSS/JS for frontend goes in public, rest go in corresponding folders

- Do not break code (in the master branch)

- Log issues in Github and then contact appropriate member of team

- Prefer tabs over spaces for indentation

- Do not introduce new features without consulting team/subteam

- Try to commit + push at the very least after a feature has been implemeneted

- Remember to commit -> pull -> resolve any conflicts -> push
